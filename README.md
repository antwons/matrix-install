### MATRIX - SYNAPSE INSTALL 

*What is this?*
> Well this is our quick and easy install for making your own Matrix - Synapse server. This chat server is brought to you by [The Matrix Foundation](https://matrix.org). This is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted chat server that you can selfhost. It has very similar features to RCS/Imessage such as chat reaction, High-res photos & videos, typing notifications and much more. Visit their link above for more information and ways to support the project!

*How to run the script?*
> Great news! Our script is now up and running for most systems. Below, please read the updated systems that have been verified as working!

#### Verified systems
1. Ubuntu 22.04 (Dekstop and Server)

#### Run Command
```
bash -c "(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antwons/matrix-install/main/build.sh))"
```
*What does this command do?*
> We will break this down, step by step. First, we are going to install git to be able to clone the repository. Second, we clone the main branch repository. Third, we are going to make the build.sh script executable. Lastly, we then run the build.sh script!
